1. Change the names of the variables in the queries provided by the user.
2. Command `unify` only works when it's asked to unify two predicates. (Should be able to work for Pred-Var, Var-Const etc, strings_to_atoms is responsible for that)
3. Throw better Parser Error 
4. Should definitions of the same rule be written consecutively?
5. Should definitions of the same rule have the same number of arguements?
6. Should all the predicates in a rule tail have a definition?
7. Maybe group rules in a smarter way? 
8. Just an idea? Maybe the parser should have a rule for a "Rule definition" and the corresponding ASTNode which is going to contain all the rule definitions (Rule ASTNodes) of that rule.
9. Try to have a simple word explanation for each component of the project.
10. Should all modules be contained in one RuleList node or should each one be stored in a separate RuleList node?.
